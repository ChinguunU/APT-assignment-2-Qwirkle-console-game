Placing a tile:
---------------

Each line can only contain one of each color and one of each shape.
The tile being placed must connect to another tile on the board

To place a tile, type: 'place <Tile> at <Coordinates>'
For example: 'place G5 at A2'

To replace a tile, type: 'replace <Tile>'
For example: 'replace G5'
You will then get a new tile in its place.
This will skip your turn.
